# Gamemodes

### Standard

Standard-Normal mode - Rember the good ole days when snake came out on your Nokia brick. This mode plays exactly how regular snake opperates. 

Standard-Fast mode mode - This mode is faster than normal snake. To make thiss possible i changed the "game loop speed" so it seams as tho it is fast. There is nothing out of the ordnary other than the speed. Just make sure to watch out for your tale!  

Standard-Infinite mode - Just like fast mode, it plays like regular snake except there is no end. to create this i removed the "self collision detection" so you can play forever. 

### Puzzle

Puzzle-Normal mode - Your goal is to fill the whole box. You are infinitely long just make sure not to run into your self. This mode was possible by removing the "remove cells" command. 

Puzzle-practice mode - this is a space where you can work on different stratiges without the concequence being reset. tis is a combo if infinite mode and puzzle mode. 

### 2 Player (COMMING SOON)

2Player-Normal mode - This is a compitition on who can be the longest snake. I plan to add this soon by creating a seccond controlable entity. 

2Player-Death Match mode - Do you happen to rember tron. This mode was inspired by the gameplay from tron. your goal it to knock out the other player witho knocking out yourself.
